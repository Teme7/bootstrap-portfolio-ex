# bootstrap-portfolio-ex

* I chose to start from scratch instead of hacking the provided bootstrap layout.

  Navbar contains name, about, portfolio, and contact tabs/links
  First row: heading and side panel
  Second row: picture and text content 

* The class "navbar-nav ml-auto" in the ul aligned the navbar links right.
